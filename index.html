  <h1>Welcome to the Z3R0-stu Webpage!</h1>
    <h3 class="close-h3">DISCLAIMER - <em>For Your Own Convenience</em></h3>
    <p class="close-p3">
        This webpage will not be of use to you, unless you like to watch people struggle.
        It is being constructed by a mindless idiot who has no idea what they are doing.
        This is my first look at HTML and web design in general, so please bear with me.
    </p>
    <h2 class="close-h2">About Me</h2>
    <p class="close-p2">
        So, the person responsible behind this mess...
    </p>
    <p>
        As a guy studying cyber, it would be counterintuitive to give away too much information about myself.
        However, I can say that I am a young student who's passionate about cybersecurity and technology.
        Z3R0 is my alias for most things online, and -stu was a forced addition because Z3R0 alone was taken.
        Why -stu? Cmon, you can figure it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interests mainly lie in cyber warfare, ethical hacking, and digital analytics/forensics.
        After my current course, I'm looking at either continuing my studies at college or joining the RAF as a cyber operator.
        As for now, I'm just trying to learn as much as I can about the field and improve my skills
        (including web design apparently.)

    </p>
    <p>
        Other than cyber, I'm a big gamer, a cadet in the RAFAC, and a kickboxer.
        Now I feel like I should stop before I give away too much info, although its probably too late for that.
        But I want to leave a message to a specific set of viewers...
    </p>
    <h3 class="close-h3">To My Fellow Cadets...</h3>

        Now, it doesn't take a genius to guess you either stumbled upon this page by accident or I shared it with you.
        OR, the most likely reason, you're a sneaky bugger who's really good at OSIT.
        If that's the case, I'm impressed, and I'll leave a little easter egg in this webpage for you - GOOD LUCK!
        (Right now that EE is under construction)

        This section of the webpage will be for me to post updates about it construction
        It may not be regular, but I will hopefully make an entry after each day of working on it
        This will also act as a change log summary to better understand my progress
